  Power of attorney revocation
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Power of attorney revocation** Easy Form.

  This program helps you create documents to cancel the power that you previously gave an agent under a Power of Attorney for Health Care or a Power of Attorney for Property.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**ending a power of attorney**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/ending-power-attorney-0).

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |  
  To use this program you must be seeking to revoke a Power of Attorney that was created under Illinois law. You will need to know:

  * The names and addresses of all the agents listed on the Power of Attorney, and
  * The date the Power of Attorney was signed.
    
  Set aside 5 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. After you print out the revocation, you will need to sign it in front of a notary.
  
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0DCAF0" ) } that also gives help.
